#==========================================#
#  Welcome to the GeBiz Analyzer program.  #
#==========================================#

GeBIZ is a Government-to-business Public eProcurement business centre where suppliers can conduct electronic commerce with the Singapore Government. All of the public sector's invitations for quotations and tenders are posted on GeBIZ.

This program allows you to view processed data regarding awarded tenders and contractor information based on two datasets:
Government Procurement - https://data.gov.sg/dataset/government-procurement
Listing of Registered Contractors - https://data.gov.sg/dataset/listing-of-registered-contractors


The Gebiz Analyzer is developed to run on Python 2.7.15, and requires the additional installation of Pandas and Matplotlib.
Python - https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2715/
Pandas - https://pandas.pydata.org/getpandas.html
Matplotlib - https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html


To start the program, please run 'main.py'.
